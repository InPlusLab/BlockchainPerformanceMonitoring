# Blockchain Performance Monitoring

This is the source code of the evaluation of the paper "A DETAILED AND REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS".
With one-line command you can replay the evaluation in the paper.

We decide to move the key back-end code here instead of ibase.site for easier following. 

As for visulization, you can choose any front-end libraries as you like.


## Too Long No Read

`unzip Logs.zip` (or manually unzip Logs.zip in the directory)

`node main.js` (if you have installed node.js)


## Qucik Start

First of all, `git clone https://github.com/tczpl/BlockchainPerformanceMonitoring.git`.

And `cd BlockchainPerformanceMonitoring`.

Or download the ZIP, if you have not installed git.

### For Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)

Install unzip: `sudo apt-get install unzip`

Install nodejs: `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

Unzip the Logs files: `unzip Logs.zip`
